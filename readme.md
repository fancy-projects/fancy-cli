# ![Fancy](fancy/assets/poster.png)

## FANCY is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that customizes folder icons.

## How to install

First, clone this repository onto your computer.

Then, run the `installer.sh` script.
This will install the CLI, making it
ready for use on the terminal.
The `dev_install.sh` is just a helper script
for packaging the code. I've already done that
for you, so you don't need to run that.

Type `fancy --help` to view all features.

## Branches Overview

- The "main" branch is expected to have almost
  bugs and should be ready for production.

- The "dev" branch is expected to have many
  bugs but should work most of the time,
  however many of the options may be broken.

- The "canary" branch is expected to be
  absolutely filled with bugs and the code
  probably won't work at all.

# IT DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS FOR NOW
